This is a React and headless WordPress site to showcase my work as a UX and web developer as well as an artist and photographer.

It contains posts for UX and web development projects, a portfolio of my photography which is divided by category, and gallery for my artworks. The site also includes a homepage, a contact form and an about section.

A fully functional WooCommerce shop is in the works. I may add a blog section in the future - that is, if I ever get around to writing anything worth showing off. Likely, I will make the animations flashier as well.

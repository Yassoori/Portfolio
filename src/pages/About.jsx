            I’m a UX designer, an artist and photographer based in Auckland, New
            Zealand. I hold a diploma in UX and Web Design (Level 6) from the
            Yoobee College of Creative Innovation.
            <br />
            <br />
            I am currently available for front end, back end, and full stack
            development or UI and UX design. I enjoy coding and find it
            fulfilling to work on the technical side of things. I have a deep
            passion for the arts and experience in the field, and love to bring
            my creative skills to web development.
            <br />
            <br />I am also a multidisciplinary artist and photographer whose
            practice stems from personal interests, experiences and research in
            architecture, history, and typography. In addition to my personal
            practice, I often make art in service of social causes and community
            projects, most prominently for fundraising and raising awareness for
            the humanitarian crisis in Sudan with the Sudanese community in
            Auckland.

            Yasser Saeed is a multidisciplinary artist and photographer of Iraqi
            descent, based in Auckland New Zealand, his birthplace. He studied
            Architecture at the University of Auckland and Fine Arts at
            Whitecliffe College of Art and Design and works with photography,
            mixed media and digital art. His work is varied in its inspirations
            from architecture to ancient Middle Eastern history and ruins to
            written script but runs the common method of abstraction of forms
            and complex compositions, with themes leaking into one another.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2018, He was awarded the Emerging Artist Award, at the Riley
            Consultants Members Merit Awards and Exhibition at Lake House Arts
            Centre, for his digital and photographic prints and his work “Text
            Experiment” was acquired by the James Wallace Arts Trust.
